---

A little **neal.fun-style catalogue** of self-contained browser games. Each game is its
own folder of static HTML/Canvas + vanilla JS — no build step, no dependencies, no
external assets — and gets a tile on the home page plus a **‹ Arcade** link back.

## Games

| Game | Folder | About |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Asteroids** | `games/asteroids/` | Fly/shoot/survive — classic arcade + roguelite modes, speedruns, mobile controls |
| **Keep Defender** | `games/tower-defense/` | Fixed-path tower defense — build towers, spend gold, hold the keep (Castle & Parchment theme) |

More to come (flappy-like, aim trainer, a magic game, …).

## Install on your phone (PWA)

The arcade is a Progressive Web App — install it to play **fullscreen & offline**, no
app store:

- **Android (Chrome):** tap the **📱 Install** button on the home page, or menu **⋮ → “Add to Home screen”**.
- **iPhone (Safari):** **Share** → **“Add to Home Screen”**.
- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge):** the **Install** button, or the install icon in the address bar.

Each game also works offline once you've opened it.

## Add a game

1. Create `games/<slug>/index.html` — self-contained, with a `‹ Arcade` link to `../../`.
2. Add one entry to **`games.js`** (`slug`, `title`, `blurb`, `icon`, `accent`, `tag`).
3. (Optional) add it to `sw.js` `SHELL` if it must be cached for first-run offline.

## Testing

```bash
node test.mjs                 # arcade: catalogue wiring + Keep Defender logic
node games/asteroids/test.mjs # the asteroids game's own suite
```

Dependency-free headless harnesses (mock the DOM/canvas, drive each game via a
`window.__test` hook). Keep them green.

## Layout

```text
index.html        catalogue (tiles from games.js) + PWA install
games.js          catalogue manifest
favicon.svg       arcade icon
manifest.json     PWA manifest      sw.js   service worker (offline)
.nojekyll         serve files as-is on GitHub Pages
test.mjs          arcade test harness
games/<slug>/     each game, standalone
```

> History note: `games/asteroids/` was imported with `git subtree` so its full
> commit history is preserved — view per-game history on GitHub via the folder's
> **History** view (`/commits/main/games/asteroids`).
