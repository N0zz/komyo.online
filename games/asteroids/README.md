A self-contained, dependency-free Asteroids game with multiple evolving versions,
each playable from a launcher. Pure HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JS — no build step,
no external assets. Just open it in a browser.

## Play

Play online at **https://n0zz.github.io/asteroids-game/**, or run it locally: open
`index.html` in any modern browser (double-click, or `open index.html` on macOS).
Pick a version from the menu. Toggle **NORMAL / SPEEDRUN** at the top before launching.

> Tip: after clicking a version, click once on the game so it has keyboard focus.

### Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `←` / `→` | Rotate ship |
| `↑` | Thrust (momentum; screen wraps) |
| `Space` | Shoot |
| `Esc` | Pause / resume |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Start / restart |
| `←` `→` `↑` `↓` + `Enter`, or `1`–`9` | Choose upgrades (roguelite picker & shop) |

## Versions

| Family | Name | File | Idea |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classic | Classic Asteroids | `classic.html` | The original arcade game |
| Classic | Classic Asteroids — Enhanced | `classic-enhanced.html` | Pause, Enter/Space start, weapon tiers |
| Roguelite | Auto Level-Up | `roguelite-levelup.html` | Enemies drop XP gems → level up → pick 1 of 3 upgrades |
| Roguelite | Score Milestones | `roguelite-milestones.html` | Score thresholds trigger the upgrade picks |
| Roguelite | Wave Shop | `roguelite-shop.html` | Spend credits in a between-wave shop |

The three roguelite builds share one engine and differ only by a single
`PROGRESSION` constant (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)). The launcher menu is data-driven
from `versions.js`.

### Roguelite features

- HP + regenerating **Shield**, escalating **waves**, a **boss every 5th wave**.
- Enemies: asteroids (split), homing **hunters**, shooting **sentries**, and bosses.
- 13 stackable upgrades: Rapid Fire, Spread, Heavy Rounds, Long Shot, Piercing,
  Shield, Hull, Thrusters, Orbital Shard, Drone, Nova Pulse, Magnet, **Auto-Fire**
  (fires for you — no holding Space).
- **Map pickups** dropped by enemies: ✛ repair (heal), ◇ shield cell, ≫ frenzy
  (temp fire-rate burst), ✸ pulse (shockwave) — so HP can be recovered mid-run.
- Endless and escalating — enemy count and HP ramp with the wave, bosses get much
  tougher past wave 10. Your run ends on death (game-over screen with score & wave).

### Speedrun mode

Launch any version with the SPEEDRUN toggle (adds `?speedrun=1`). A timer runs while
you play (frozen during pause / upgrade screens). Goal: **2000 points** (Classic) or
**clear wave 5 — the first boss** (Roguelite). Best times are saved to `localStorage`
and shown on the menu cards.

## Project layout

```
index.html                launcher (version select + mode toggle), reads versions.js
versions.js               the version manifest (single source of truth for the menu)
classic.html              ┐
classic-enhanced.html     │ self-contained game builds (each is one standalone .html)
roguelite-levelup.html    │ (the roguelite base; the two below are generated from it)
roguelite-milestones.html │
roguelite-shop.html       ┘
test.mjs                  headless test harness (Node) — runs every game's loop
DESIGN.md                 design spec / decisions
```

## Testing

```bash
node test.mjs
```

A headless harness mocks the DOM/canvas, runs each game's `requestAnimationFrame`
loop, simulates input, and asserts behavior (start/pause/death, waves & boss,
upgrades, keyboard nav, shop economy, speedrun win, launcher wiring). It needs no
browser or dependencies.
