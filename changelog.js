// Player-facing changelog — newest first. Single source of truth for BOTH the in-page
// 🗒️ Changelog modal (index.html) AND the Discord changelog post: the GitHub Action posts
// only the entries ADDED in a push (diff vs the previous commit), so Discord == this file.
// One release per date: { date:'YYYY-MM-DD', title:'…', items:['New: …','Fix: …'] }.
// Keep bullets plain-language and about what a PLAYER notices — never kit/test/build/refactor.
