// Player-facing changelog — newest first. Single source of truth for BOTH the in-page
// 🗒️ Changelog modal (index.html) AND the Discord changelog post: the GitHub Action posts
// only the entries ADDED in a push (diff vs the previous commit), so Discord == this file.
// One release per date: { date:'YYYY-MM-DD', title:'…', items:['New: …','Fix: …'] }.
// Keep bullets plain-language and about what a PLAYER notices — never kit/test/build/refactor.

  { date: '2026-06-29', title: 'Polish & fixes', items: [
    'Fix: on narrow phones the top bar no longer crowds itself — the Menu button and the sound/pause buttons keep clear of each other.',
    'Fix: the ‹ Menu button now only shows while you’re actually playing, not on a game’s own menu (where it was easy to mistake for “back to the website”).',
    'Fix: Range — on phones the shot marker now stays exactly where you fired, instead of drifting along with your finger.',
  ] },
  { date: '2026-06-28', title: 'Challenges, score cards & more', items: [
    'New: game tiles now show up to three genre tags, each in its own consistent color, and you can filter by any of them.',
    'New: a stack of fresh games is on the way — peek the "coming soon" tiles for what we’re building next.',
    'Fix: Keep Defender — the castle and path no longer clip off the screen edge, and the board clears the score bar.',
    'Fix: Bubble Pop — in landscape on phones the starting bubbles no longer crowd the launcher.',
    'Fix: Asteroids+ — the boss no longer overlaps the score bar on phone screens.',
    'New: Asteroids+ — the roguelite Asteroids (XP, upgrades, bosses, a wave shop) is now its own game. Plain Asteroids is the classic arcade one. Pick your mode right inside each game.',
    'New: Daily & Weekly Challenges — tap 🏆 for today’s challenge plus a bigger weekly one. Earn points (1 per daily, 5 per weekly) that only ever go up, with a History list of everything you’ve completed (up to a year, "Load more" to go back).',
    'New: Score cards — share a picture of your score from the end screen (📷), straight to your apps.',
    'New: Embed games on your own site or blog — an Embed button in each game’s sound menu, plus "Embed a game" in the main menu.',
    'New: a ⏸ pause button in every game (top-right, next to sound).',
    'New: Export / import your data — back it up or move it between devices, no account needed (in the menu under "Your data").',
    'New: a Compact tile view (button by the filters) so more games fit on screen, plus an FAQ and a Privacy policy in the menu.',
    'New: Neon Snake has on-screen arrow buttons on phones — tap to turn instead of swiping; drag the pad anywhere, or tuck it away (and bring it back) with the ✕ / 🎮 button.',
    'New: Brick Breaker on phones — hold the left or right side of the screen to slide the paddle (instead of dragging).',
    'New: Bubble Pop modes — Arcade and Endless now build pressure as you shoot rather than on a clock, with a new Speedrun mode that keeps the timer. Your loaded bubble also auto-swaps if its color is no longer on the board.',
    'Fix: games now re-fit correctly when you rotate your phone between portrait and landscape — Stack stays centered, Brick Breaker keeps room to react, Bubble Pop sticks to portrait on phones, Tower Defense’s menu and keep fit the screen, Asteroids’ end screen fits in landscape.',
    'Fix: Brick Breaker — the paddle now moves instantly and stops the moment you let go; in portrait the top bricks no longer hide under the score bar.',
    'Fix: Brick Breaker — the paddle waits centered until you launch, and the on-screen ◀ ▶ move hints now show in portrait too (not just landscape).',
    'Fix: Asteroids & Asteroids+ — a mode is preselected so Play works right away, and picking a mode now works on phones.',
    'Fix: the Filter panel now fits the screen on phones in landscape — it no longer runs off the edge, and the genre list scrolls.',
    'Fix: Range’s "race to 100" progress bar now tracks targets hit, not points.',
    'Fix: Keep Defender — the upgrade button is greyed out until you can afford it, then pops in.',
  ] },
  { date: '2026-06-27', title: 'We are now Komyo Games', items: [
    'New name & logo: funyo is now Komyo Games — same games, fresh fox mascot.',

  ] },
  { date: '2026-06-27', title: 'Home redesign & polish', items: [

    'New: NEW and UPDATED badges on game tiles, so fresh and recently-improved games are easy to spot.',
    'New: “Reset all data” to clear your scores, progress and favorites across every game.',
    'New: this changelog 🙂',
    'Fix: Brick Breaker ran too fast on some phones — speed is now consistent everywhere.',
    'Fix: Range “Sprint” is now a proper race to 100 targets.',
